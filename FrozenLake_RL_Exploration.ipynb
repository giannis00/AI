    "1. **Reset the environment** to obtain the **initial state**.  \n",
    "2. **Starting state (state 0):**  \n",
    "   - Select a **random action** from `DOWN (1)`, `RIGHT (2)`, or `UP (3)`  \n",
    "   - Adds **variety** and prevents potential stuck scenarios  \n",
    "3. **Other states:**  \n",
    "   - Choose the **greedy action** (highest Q-value) from the **trained Q-table**  \n",
    "4. **Print** the current state and chosen action using the **`actions` dictionary** for readability  \n",
    "5. **Step the environment** to get the **next state**, **reward**, and **termination flags**  \n",
    "   - Render the agent’s movement as an **elf** in a popup window  \n",
    "6. **Loop ends** when the agent reaches the **goal** or falls into a **hole** (`done = True`)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visual inspection of the agent's path on the frozen lake grid  \n",
    "- Confirms that the **trained Q-table policy** guides the agent effectively toward the goal  \n",
    "\n",
    "> ✅ This method allows us to **see the agent in action** and understand its learned behavior in a human-readable, graphical format.\n"

    "- **Change the starting state:**  \n",

    "  - Lower epsilon → less exploration, agent may get stuck in suboptimal paths  \n",
    "  - Higher gamma → agent values long-term rewards more  \n",
    "  - More episodes → Q-values converge more accurately  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enable slippery mode:**  \n",
    "  Set `is_slippery=True` and see how the **randomness in actions** affects the learned policy. How does the agent adapt to uncertainty?  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inspect the Q-table:**  \n",
    "  Look at the rounded Q-values for different states. Which actions are preferred? How do changes in hyperparameters affect these preferences?  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visual observation:**  \n",
    "  Watch the agent move on the frozen lake. Try different paths and starting points. Can you predict its actions before they happen?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Tip:** Experimenting and observing the outputs will help you **understand the effects of hyperparameters, randomness, and learning in Q-Learning**. Take notes on how the policy changes and what it tells you about the agent's decision-making process.\n"
